# DevContainer

As of November 2022, VSCode DevContainers extension does not support [profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/) feature of Docker-Compose v3.9 ([GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/5795))

Therefore, these example devcontainer settings do not work now.
